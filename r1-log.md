## Log

### R1D1 
Started work on a portfolio to showcase apps I've developed for the sport of ultimate frisbee.
Was happy to be able to write a custom hook on the first few tries to allow visitors to "like" any of the projects
(This was something that used to be a lot more difficult for me to implement)

### R1D2
Got the basic portfolio up and running and waiting for the DNS to update so I can get it posted!
