## Log

### R1D1 
Started work on a portfolio to showcase apps I've developed for the sport of ultimate frisbee.
Was happy to be able to write a custom hook on the first few tries to allow visitors to "like" any of the projects
(This was something that used to be a lot more difficult for me to implement)

### R1D2
Got the basic portfolio up and running and waiting for the DNS to update so I can get it posted!

### R1D3
A lot of just updating packages and fighting with Heroku but finally got the deployment to work! The beginning of a website to share some Ultimate Frisbee related tools: http://ultideveloper.herokuapp.com

### R1D4
Worked with Nodejs to get a better understanding of backend development and created a server

### R1D5
Started putting together a MERN application with the goal of making a public facing API

### R1D6
Connected a database to a backend server and made some progress with an API!

### R1D7
Got a basic REST API working, connected to a DB, and created 3 endpoints. Still working on getting some of the backend logic to work, but much smoother sailing

### R1D8
Backend logic is all working how I had hoped so calling the demo finished. Thinking about trying the same application with a GraphQL backend

### R1D9
Did some bug squashing and got the toolbox for Ultimate deployed to www.ultideveloper.com
