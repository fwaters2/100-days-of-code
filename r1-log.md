# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Forrest Waters

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 14th, Tuesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started work on a portfolio to showcase apps I've developed for the sport of ultimate frisbee.
Was happy to be able to write a custom hook on the first few tries to allow visitors to "like" any of the projects
(This was something that used to be a lot more difficult for me to implement)

### R1D2
Got the basic portfolio up and running and waiting for the DNS to update so I can get it posted!

### R1D3
A lot of just updating packages and fighting with Heroku but finally got the deployment to work! The beginning of a website to share some Ultimate Frisbee related tools: http://ultideveloper.herokuapp.com

### R1D4
Worked with Nodejs to get a better understanding of backend development and created a server

### R1D5
Started putting together a MERN application with the goal of making a public facing API

### R1D6
Connected a database to a backend server and made some progress with an API!

### R1D7
Got a basic REST API working, connected to a DB, and created 3 endpoints. Still working on getting some of the backend logic to work, but much smoother sailing

### R1D8
Backend logic is all working how I had hoped so calling the demo finished. Thinking about trying the same application with a GraphQL backend

### R1D9
Did some bug squashing and got the toolbox for Ultimate deployed to www.ultideveloper.com

### R1D10
Day 10 of #100DaysOfCode. Started a project turning old csv files into a query-able api

### R1D11
Continued working on the REST API for a pile of statistics. Also spent some time dipping my toes into the opensource community by creating an issue, and submitting my first pull request to strangers! Striving not to be a Richard! https://gist.github.com/frnz/871723

### R1D12
Spent the day researching options for cloud hosting options and trying out different query languages. Really starting to miss front-end development!

### R1D13
Some days things just seem to go right. Finally settled on a mysql database with a nodejs backend hosted on Heroku for the REST API. Super grateful for all the amazing open source projects out there and all the informative blogs and replies to stack-overflow questions. 

### R1D14
Took a break from the backend project and refactored some old front end code. Ever have one of those extension chords that almost reaches an outlet and then you straigten out a tangle and it reaches? I feel like that :)

### R1D15
Didn't have a ton of time today, but spent an hour or so writing API queries

### R1D16
Needed a break so worked on some algorithms on Leetcode!

### R1D17
Started working for a Ultimate Frisbee CLIENT!!! Mostly reading code and getting the development environment set up. But very exciting none the less. I get to do my two favorite things.

### R1D18
Migrated some test data from a MongoDB database and started work on an admin panel for my client.
